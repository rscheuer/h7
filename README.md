# Parts

Open source collection of unique, one-off Svelte components.

## Mission

The goal of this project is to develop novel interfaces/interactions, all scoped to a single component file with minimal dependencies.

Each **_Part_** can be copied from this repo and pasted into any project that is using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Fractils](https://github.com/FractalHQ/fractils).

<br/>

## Developing

Install dependencies with `pnpm install` and start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

<br/>

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
pnpm build
```
